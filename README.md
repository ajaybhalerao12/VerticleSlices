# VerticleSlices

## Description

VerticalSlices is a .NET Core project that demonstrates the implementation of vertical slice architecture. This approach enhances maintainability, testability, and scalability by organizing code by feature rather than technical concern

## Features

- Feature-Based Structure: Organizes the application by features, each having its own directory.
- Decoupled Architecture: Promotes modularity and reduces dependencies.
- Improved Testability: Allows testing of individual slices independently.
- Scalability: Facilitates easy addition and modification of features.

## Technologies
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
